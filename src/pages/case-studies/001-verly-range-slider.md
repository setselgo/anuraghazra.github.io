title: Verly Range Slider
excerpt: Verly Range Slider is one of my fun projects which uses my Verly.js physics engine, it was also mentioned in CodepenSpark. verly range slider got viral on th net and got over 15K views on codepen.io. it uses Verlet physics to simulate those delighful dangly sliders.

info:
  idea: main idea was to make some verlet simulated ropes and connect them to the rang slider's thumb and let them sway

While I was building my physics engine [Verly.js](http://anuraghazra.github.io/Verly.js) I was thinking of making something that would showcase the engine's potential to do some interesting stuff, so I created this just as an experiment. 


- so far VerlyRangeSlider got over **18K Views** on [Codepen](https://codepen.io/anuraghazra/pen/agKJEd)
- got mentioned in **[CodepenSpark #136](https://codepen.io/spark/136)**
- showcased in **[justforfun.io](https://justforfun.io/post/verly-range-slider)**
- and **40 stars** on Github

## How It Works?

It works by using Verly.js's `verly.createRope(x, y, segments, gap, pin)` function which takes some arguments - `x` and `y` for location of the rope, `segments` which determines the dots count in the rope (more dots, more fluid rope), `gap` which specifies the distance between each dot (more gap, longer rope), and lastly `pin` which just pins the defined point.



> i created a `verly instace` for every input slider present on the screen. 

```js
let DOMSlider = document.getElementById(id);
let canvas = document.createElement('canvas');
let ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');
// canvas width is equal to the slider's width 
let width = DOMSlider.scrollWidth;
let height = width / 2;
canvas.width = width;
canvas.height = height;
canvas.style.pointerEvents = 'none';
// offsetting the position so its lines up
canvas.style.transform = 'translate(0, -15px)';
DOMSlider.parentElement.appendChild(canvas);

// -- then initialized verly
// new Verly(iteration, canvas, ctx)
let verly = new Verly(50, canvas, ctx);
// added some gravity
const gravity = new Vector(0, 0.3);
```

after that, i created the rope with

```js
// width / 20 to adjust the segments depending on the screen size
// highlight-next-line
let rope = verly.createRope(0, 0, width / 20, 17, 0);
let lastIndex = rope.points.length - 1;

rope.setGravity(gravity);
// i pinned the last dot of the rope
rope.pin(lastIndex);
```

#### Getting the slider's position and applying it to the rope
now the actual part where i fix the last dot's position with the slider's thumb.
to do this we can take the slider's `value` and normalize it so it's between 0 and 1 and then multiply the normalized value with the width to get the slider's thumb position... (yeah i did not bother to use shadowDOM because of browser compatibility and vendor issues) but my solution works kinda ok.

```js
function setRopePosition() {
  // get the normalized value of the slider
  // highlight-next-line
  let ratio = (DOMSlider.value - DOMSlider.min) / (DOMSlider.max - DOMSlider.min);
  // then just apply it to the last dot of the rope
  rope.points[rope.points.length - 1].pos.x = (ratio * width);
}
// and use event listener
DOMSlider.addEventListener('input', setRopePosition);
```

okay this works!
but i noticed something weird behavior with this.

the problem was for some reason (probably floating point precision) the slider's position was offseting a bit while moving towards the edge, so i had to think some ways to prevent this. then i ended up with this solution (yeah crazy but works)

```js
function setRopePosition() {
  let ratio = (DOMSlider.value - DOMSlider.min) / (DOMSlider.max - DOMSlider.min);

  // highlight-start
  // floating point correction
  if (ratio < 0.5) ratio += 0.01;
  if (ratio < 0.3) ratio += 0.01;
  if (ratio > 0.6) ratio -= 0.01;
  if (ratio > 0.8) ratio -= 0.02;
  // highlight-end

  rope.points[rope.points.length - 1].pos.x = (ratio * width);
}

```

nice!

now we can just render the scene and update the physics

```js
function animate() {
  ctx.clearRect(0, 0, width, height);
  
  verly.update();
  // rendering the rope
  rope.renderSticks();

  requestAnimationFrame(animate);
}
animate();
```

and we are done!
